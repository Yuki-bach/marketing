## Git Cheat Sheet for Team Collaboration

```
1. Update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote:
$ git switch main
$ git pull

2. Create a new branch and switch to it:
$ git switch -c your-branch-name

3. Make some changes to code

4. Stage all changes for commit:
$ git add -A

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
$ git commit -m "what you did and/or why you did"

6. Push your branch to the remote repository:
$ git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name

7. Go to the github "Pull Request" page, and create the Pull Request

As for the 4 and 5, you can also do this using vscode.
